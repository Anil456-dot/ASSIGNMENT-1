# ##TASK4
# Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
# 2.   Prints its content line by line.
# 3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

####-------SOLUTION-1---------

file1 = open('sample.txt')   ## If the file exists:
print(file1.read())
file1.close()
##result :-
# Line 1: This a sample text file.
# Line 2: It contains multiple lines

file = open('sample.txt')  ## If the file does not exist:
print(file)
##result :- FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'sample.txt'


# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
# 2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
# 3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.
